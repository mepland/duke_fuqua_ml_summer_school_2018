My work for the 2018 Duke Fuqua Machine Learning Summer School, June 25-29  

## Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mepland/duke_fuqua_ml_summer_school_2018.git
```

## Installing Dependencies
It is recommended to work in a `virtualenv` to avoid clashes with other installed software. A useful extension for this purpose is [`virtualenvwrapper`](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Follow the instructions in the documentation to install and initialize wrapper before continuing.  

```bash
mkvirtualenv fuquaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Later you can re-load the virtualenv with:  

```bash
workon fuquaml
```

## Launching Jupyter
```bash
jupyter lab
```
